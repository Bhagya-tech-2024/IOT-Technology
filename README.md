# IOT-Technology

My group partner and I worked together to create a smart car powered by a Raspberry Pi. We combined hardware and software to enable features like remote control, sensor-based navigation, and real-time data processing. This project gave me hands-on experience with IoT and embedded systems while also strengthening my teamwork and problem-solving skills. It was an exciting opportunity to explore how Raspberry Pi can be used in automation and robotics.
